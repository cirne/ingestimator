# Why a shared directory?

While Ingestimator currently only has one nerdlet, I'd like to add more in the future.

Specifically, a nerdlet that estimates the telemetry ingest cost for a specific application
or host. That nerdlet would show up in the Explorer when the user selects an application (or host)
and also potentially as an overlay above the main Ingestimator application.
